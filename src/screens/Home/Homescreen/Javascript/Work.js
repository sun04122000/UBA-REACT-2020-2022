                            <p align="justify">One of the main problems for rural India is not being at the same pace of development as the urban counterpart. This is due to the lack of schemes, that involve the participation from all the stakeholders. There is a gap between the government policies and its beneficiaries. The gap widens with every initiative of the government that fails to reach the remotest parts of the country. However, in a country with a population of over 1.25 billion, it is overwhelmingly difficult to design an initiative that benefits all. Therefore, there is a need to synergize the efforts of Academia- Government-Industries & Society in every area to orchestrate ground level models for technological, social as well as administerial betterment of rural India.</p>
