But the villagers often neglect the health of their cattle, which leads to various diseases among them. So, to increase the productivity and the health conditions of cattle in the village the team organized a veterinary camp in the village with an aim to provide vaccination to the cattle against Foot and Mouth Diseases (FMD) which may affect their health severely. Animals with FMD typically have fever and blisters on tongue and lips, in and around the mouth, on mammary glands and around the hooves. FMD, apart from being harmful to animals, also causes production loss and hardship for farmers and ranchers.The aim of this camp was not only to provide vaccination to cattle but also to create awareness among villagers regarding the importance of timely vaccination of cattle for disease prevention and health improvement.The camp started on April 6, 2019 and continued for three days up to 9 April 2019. 1695 cattle were vaccinated in the camp. We made the villagers aware of the fact that health and hygiene in cattle are as much important as in humans."

The motive behind the camp was to motivate students for attending the school regularly and for better performance in academics. With due permission of DoSW IIT Roorkee, the whole initiative took place in which unclaimed cycles were collected from various Bhawans and were completely repaired before donation. Cycle donation took place in front of the whole school with the idea to inspire students to work harder in academics and reach new heights of success. The principal of secondary school shared some of his views advising the students to focus more on academics and appreciated this initiative by Team UBA.'

It was also observed that the village lacks the presence of a female doctor because which many problems of the female population are ignored. Hence, most of the people consult the doctors of nearby cities, which can be tricky in cases of undiagnosed disease and emergencies.Therefore, it is necessary to avail better health facilities for all the villagers through a free health camp. It will also create awareness about health responsibilities of the villagers and will be very helpful to the families living below the poverty line.The major problem is the lack of awareness among the people. Through the Health Survey and interaction with the people of the village over such a long period, the team realized that many people of the villagers are unaware of the various health policies offered by the government.Also, some people are afraid to go to any other place for treatment. Women used to be involved in household activities as well as in the work they do. So, the complaint of back-paining, joints pain etc. are generally neglected.Therefore, the purpose of the event is to treat the villagers and aware them about the policies and the facilities that the government offers to the citizens.The Health Camp conducted by UBA in Beladi-Salhapur has greatly benefitted the poor section of the society and all the age groups ranging from less than a year to over 85. Through this camp, the villagers were given a prescription, basic health problems and sicknesses are diagnosed with free medicines. We conducted the camp in Primary School because of its large space and prime location.Both males and females came out in a fair proportion in the camp. The camp benefitted more than 160 people in the village.'

Self-defense is an overlooked skill in our society, but it’s significant. Life is a gift. It’s also unpredictable. Self-defense helps to prepare for unexpected situations and also helps develop increased mental and physical health for both, boys and girls.Learning self-defense helps develop a sort of warrior spirit. If one is attacked, having self-defense on own side can help prevent that from happening. So, keeping this in mind, Team UBA decided to organize a Self- defense Camp on September 30, 2018, in village Beladi in collaboration with the IIT Roorkee Taekwondo Team to teach some techniques to the students so that they could defend themselves when confronted with any unwanted situation.'

They not only enrich the students' and residents' lives, but they also enhance the Earth that they now inhabit.Tree plantation in schools would help in raising awareness about the importance of trees and shrubs. The best way to inspire love for nature is to start imbibing it at a young age. By having students learn every aspect of tree planting and care, from picking a species to putting it in the ground and everything in between, it becomes second nature to them. With this thought in mind, Team UBA, IITR decided to conduct a tree plantation drive in the schools of adopted village Beladi-Salhapur. In the event, both students and teachers enthusiastically took part. A total of 25 plants of 4 different varieties were planted. 15 plants were planted in the Primary School of the village, and 10 plants were planted in the Secondary School of the village.`

        - Proper furniture
        - Repair of leaking ceiling
        - Computer installation
        - Projector and smartboard
        
        October 12, 2019 marked the inauguration of Digi school at GIC, Horawala. Teachers and students were taught to operate the smartboard by the volunteers of Srijan Foundation as well as members of UBA.
