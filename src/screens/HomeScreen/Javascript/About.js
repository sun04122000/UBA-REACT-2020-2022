Its mission is conceptualized as a movement to enable processes that connect institutes of higher education with local communities to address the developmental challenges of rural India through participatory processes and appropriate technologies for accelerating sustainable growth. It also aims to create a virtuous cycle between the society and an inclusive university system by providing knowledge and practices for emerging professions and to upgrade the capabilities of both the public and the private sectors.
                                    <br /><br /> Under the aegis of UBA, IIT Roorkee has identified 8 villages namely Beladi-Salhapur, Chandpur-Khurd, Chandpur-Kala, Horawala, Chharba, Jhabarpur, Meerpur-Muwazarpur and Puranpur-Salhapur. The student team identifies problems persisting in the villages and proposes solutions pertaining to the fields including but not limited to sanitation & cleanliness, education, skill development, agriculture, physical infrastructure, social and institutional infrastructure. The team promotes alternative and eco-friendly methods of farming like organic farming, alternative energy sources like biogas in the villages. It also promotes various govt. schemes in the above-mentioned villages like the DELP scheme, MSBY of Uttarakhand, Skill India etc.

                            The modus operandi of UBA is very similar to the SIIRD model which focused on identification
                            of demand in a bottom-up approach rather than enforcing suppliers’ decisions in a top-down
                            one.
